        Portugal national team.

        Ronaldo began his international career with Portugal under-15 in 2001.
        During his international youth career, Ronaldo would represent the
        under-15, under-17, under-20, under-21 and under-23 national sides,
        amassing 34 youth caps and scoring 18 goals overall.

        As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995, where
        his father was the kit man, and later spent two years with Nacional.
        In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who
        signed him for a fee of £1,500. He subsequently moved from Madeira
        to Alcochete, near Lisbon, to join Sporting's youth academy. By age
        14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and
        agreed with his mother to cease his education to focus entirely on
        football. With a troubled life as a student and living in Lisbon
        area away from his Madeiran family, he did not complete schooling beyond
        the 6th grade.

        Ronaldo was Portugal's second-highest scorer in their qualification
        group for the 2006 FIFA World Cup with seven goals. During the
        tournament, he scored his first World Cup goal against Iran with a
        penalty kick in Portugal's second match of the group stage. At the
        age of 21 years and 132 days, Ronaldo became the youngest ever
        goalscorer for Portugal at a World Cup finals. In Portugal's
        infamously dirty round of 16 match against the Netherlands, Ronaldo was
        forced off injured in the first half after a tackle from Dutch defender
        Khalid Boulahrouz. Following Portugal's 1–0 win, Ronaldo accused
        Boulahrouz of intentionally trying to injure him, although he recovered
        in time to play in the next game.

        Vujicic is a Christian and an evangelist. He travels and speaks about
        his testimony of faith in Jesus Christ. His ministry is known as Life
        Without Limbs. As of 2008, the ministry was based in southern
        California. Vujicic appeared on the ABC television show 20/20 in
        2008.

      <p>
        Vujicic was born in Melbourne, Australia, in 1982 to Dušanka and
        Borislav Vujičić, Serbian immigrants from Yugoslavia.Vujicic's
        father is a pastor. Vujicic was born with tetra-amelia syndrome, a
        rare disorder characterised by the absence of arms and legs.
        According to Vujicic's autobiography, his mother refused to see him or
        hold him immediately after his birth; instead, she and her husband left
        the hospital. He was bullied at school because of his medical condition.
        At one point, Vujicic attempted to commit suicide by drowning himself,
        but he was saved. While Vujicic's parents initially struggled with
        grief and confusion about his condition, they "raised him to look at the
        bright side of life".
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally, the toes of one of Vujicic's feet were fused. An operation
        was performed to separate the toes so that he can use them as fingers.
        Vujicic refers to this foot as his "chicken drumstick". When
        Vujicic was 17 years old, he started giving inspirational talks at
        school and church-sponsored events. Vujicic graduated from Griffith
        University at the age of 21 with a Bachelor of Commerce degree, with a
        double major in accountancy and financial planning.
